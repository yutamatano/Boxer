## 🥊 Boxer: Robust Lifting of Open-World 2D Bounding Boxes to 3D

> 🎉 **Boxer has been accepted to ECCV 2026!**

![Boxer System Architecture](docs/images/boxer_system.jpg)

Boxer lifts 2D object detections into static, global, fused 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) from posed images and semi-dense point clouds, focused on indoor object detection. This repo contains the code and pre-trained model (no training code) needed to run Boxer on a variety of input data sources (inference only code).

## Installation

We tested on MacOS (with mps acceleration) and Fedora (with CUDA acceleration).

```bash
# Install uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment with uv
uv venv boxer --python 3.12
source boxer/bin/activate

# Core dependencies for running Boxer
uv pip install 'torch>=2.0' numpy opencv-python tqdm dill

# To support Project Aria loading
uv pip install projectaria-tools

# 3D interactive viewer for view_*.py scripts
uv pip install moderngl moderngl-window imgui-bundle
```

## Download Model Checkpoints

We host model checkpoints for BoxerNet, DinoV3 and OWLv2 on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/facebook/boxer). Download them to the `ckpts/` directory:

```bash
bash scripts/download_ckpts.sh
```

## Download Sample Project Aria Data

In this repo, we provide sample code for running on the following data sources:
* Project Aria Gen 1 & 2
* CA-1M
* SUN-RGBD
* ScanNet (manual download needed)

Let's first start with Aria data. We host three sample [Project Aria](https://www.projectaria.com/) sequences (hohen_gen1, nym10_gen1, cook0_gen2) on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/boxer). Download them to the `sample_data/` directory:

```bash
bash scripts/download_aria_data.sh
```

## Demo #1: Hello World / Run BoxerNet in headless mode
For this first demo, you do not need to have a display, so it will work if you are SSH'ed into a server. This will run BoxerNet on the first 90 images of a sequence from the test set of the [NymeriaPlus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.18496v1) dataset. This will confirm we can load up the data and run a forward passes with the model alongside the online tracker.

Expected to take ~2 mins on mac MPS, <15 secs on CUDA.

```bash
python run_boxer.py --input nym10_gen1 --max_n=90 --track
```

This will dump out static images and a video to `outputs/nym10_gen1/`, e.g. something like this in `outputs/nym10_gen1/boxer_viz_current.png`

![Run Boxer Demo](docs/images/boxer_viz_current_hohen_gen1.jpg)

## Demo #2: BoxerNet Interactive Demo on Aria Data
For this demo, you need to have a valid display to have the GUI work. This demo allows you to create 2DBB prompts and enter text to prompt OWL to detect objects. Run it like:
```bash
python view_prompt.py --input nym10_gen1
```

You should see a window that looks like this:

![View Prompt Demo](docs/images/view_prompt_demo.jpg)

You can also run it on the other Project Aria sequences:
* python view_prompt.py --input hohen_gen1
* python view_prompt.py --input cook0_gen2

## Demo #3: Visualize Offline Fusion

Make sure to run Demo #1 first. This generates 2DBB and 3DBB csv files, for example:
* output/nym10_gen1/boxer_3dbbs.csv
* output/nym10_gen1/owl_2dbbs.csv

Then, run the fusion script, which will by default search the above paths, to load and fuse the 3DBBs from above.

```bash
python view_fusion.py --input nym10_gen1
```

You should see a window like this:

![View Fusion Demo](docs/images/view_fusion_demo.jpg)

## Demo #4: Online Tracker (requires Demo #1)

Make sure to run Demo #1 above first to generate the 2DBB and 3DBB CSVs. Run the online tracker, which will estimate 3DBBs on the fly as new images are observed:

```bash
python view_tracker.py --input nym10_gen1 --autoplay
```

## Demo #5: Running on CA-1M data

Extract a sample validation sequence (ca1m-val-42898570) to sample_data/
```bash
python scripts/download_ca1m_sample.py
```

Run the view_prompt.py script on it:
```bash
python view_prompt.py --input ca1m-val-42898570
```

You should see a window like this:

![CA-1M Prompt](docs/images/ca1m_screenshot.jpg)

## Demo #6: Running on SUN-RGBD data

Download a subset of Omni3D SUN-RGBD: extract 20 sample images to sample_data/
```bash
python scripts/download_omni3d_sample.py
```

Run the view_prompt.py script on it:
```bash
python view_prompt.py --input SUNRGBD
```

You should see a window like this:

![SUNRGBD Prompt](docs/images/sunrgbd_screenshot.jpg)

## Demo #7: Running on ScanNet data

ScanNet must be manually downloaded from https://github.com/scannet/scannet. Once you do that, place the scene directory in sample_data/, e.g. sample_data/scene0707_00

Run just like the above examples:

```bash
python view_prompt.py --input scene0707_00
```

![ScanNet Prompt](docs/images/scannet_screenshot.jpg)

## Neon recordings (scene video, with or without point clouds)

Install the optional official native-recording reader in the Boxer environment:

```bash
uv pip install 'pupil-labs-neon-recording>=2.1.6,<3'
```

`run_boxer.py` detects folders containing `Neon Scene Camera v1 ps*.mp4`.
It reads the scene video, `.time` timestamps and `calibration.bin`, and rectifies
the image to a pinhole camera before inference. Eye videos are not scene input.
The two sample recordings can be run with the existing checkpoints:

```bash
python run_boxer.py --input 2026-09-30_15-22-47 --point_cloud off --start_n 0 --max_n 90
python run_boxer.py --input 2026-09-30_17-54-53 --point_cloud off --start_n 0 --max_n 90
```

Add `--skip_viz` for CSV-only output or `--force_cpu` for CPU inference.
`--start_n` is a zero-based source frame index (the existing CLI default is 1);
`--skip_n` is the source-frame stride and `--max_n` limits the selected frames.

- `--point_cloud auto` (default): use supplied points; Neon without geometry uses no points.
- `--point_cloud off` (also `--no_sdp`): supply an empty point tensor. All depth
  patches use the existing missing-depth value `-1`; model weights are unchanged.
  Aria point/observation files are not loaded in this mode.
- `--point_cloud on`: require valid points in every processed frame; missing
  points cause an error rather than a silent fallback.

Without a camera trajectory, the 3D boxes are **independent per-frame estimates**
in an assumed-upright local frame: X right, Y camera-forward, Z up. The camera
origin is reset for each frame. This is not a measured world trajectory or gravity
alignment; metric depth/size and prediction quality without points are unverified.
`--track` and `--fuse` therefore require external registered camera poses for Neon.
In this frame-only mode, IMU orientation and gaze are not fused into predictions.

Alongside the existing box CSVs, Neon writes `boxer_input.json` (coordinate/input
semantics, original intrinsics and distortion) and `boxer_frames.csv` (selected
source frame IDs, `.time` and `.time_aux` values). The prefix follows `--write_name`.
The frame table includes frames with zero detections; box CSVs contain detections
only. `.time` is the primary clock, matching the official reader; `.time_aux` is
preserved separately (`-1` if absent). Timestamps remain integer nanoseconds.
To overlay raw gaze later, apply the same undistortion and resize to its pixel
coordinates. The generated JPEG/MP4 visualization supports Neon; the separate
interactive `view_*.py` loaders do not yet support Neon recordings.

### External point clouds and camera poses

Use `--neon_geometry /path/to/registered_geometry.npz` to provide geometry derived
from a phone or reconstruction. The NPZ must contain:

| Key | Shape / dtype | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timestamps_ns` | `(F,)`, `int64`, strictly increasing | Exact scene `.time` values; must cover every selected frame |
| `T_world_camera` | `(F, 4, 4)`, float | Rigid scene-camera-to-world transforms; right-handed Z-up world, translations in metres |
| `points_world` (optional) | `(N, 3)` or `(F, N, 3)`, float | Static world map or per-frame observed points, in the same world frame and metres; all-NaN rows may pad variable counts |

Camera coordinates follow OpenCV: X right, Y down, Z forward. Register both phone
geometry and **Neon scene-camera poses** to the same world before exporting;
a phone pose cannot be used as the Neon pose without this alignment. Synchronize
the device clocks and interpolate poses to the exact scene timestamps upstream.
The loader deliberately does not guess a clock offset, metric scale or extrinsics.

```python
# These arrays must come from your calibrated, time-aligned reconstruction.
np.savez("registered_geometry.npz", timestamps_ns=scene_times_ns,
         T_world_camera=neon_camera_to_world, points_world=registered_points)
```

```bash
# Use points and poses for 3D inference / tracking.
python run_boxer.py --input 2026-09-30_15-22-47 --neon_geometry registered_geometry.npz --point_cloud on --track
# Use the same poses, but remove depth input for a controlled comparison.
python run_boxer.py --input 2026-09-30_15-22-47 --neon_geometry registered_geometry.npz --point_cloud off --write_name boxer_no_points
```

Pose-only NPZ files also work with `auto` or `off`. Static map points inform
BoxerNet depth input but are not passed as evidence of current visibility to the
tracker. Only per-frame observed points provide that evidence; without them the
tracker uses its existing projection-only aging fallback. No-point operation
thus loses both measured depth input and point-based visibility evidence.

### Estimate Neon camera poses from scene video and IMU

The optional offline adapter uses **monocular-inertial ORB-SLAM3**. It does not
change BoxerNet, the tracker, or fusion. Its outputs are continuous pose-only
segments that the existing `--neon_geometry` option accepts. This does not add
Neon support to the interactive `view_tracker.py` loader.

Install `scipy` in the Boxer Python environment for the rotation/synchronization
and trajectory-conversion utilities (`uv pip install scipy`).

On Linux, first provide CMake, a C++17 compiler, OpenCV >= 4.4, Eigen3, Boost
serialization, OpenSSL, GLEW, OpenGL and X11 development packages. For example,
the Ubuntu packages are `cmake libopencv-dev libeigen3-dev
libboost-serialization-dev libssl-dev libglew-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev`.
The build helper also accepts dependencies installed under a local prefix;
no dependencies or recordings are committed to this repository.
The helper uses one compiler process and `-O1` for the ORB core to limit initial
build memory. It prefers Clang when available, otherwise GCC; `CXX` selects the
compiler explicitly. `NEON_BUILD_JOBS` overrides the job count. If changing
compilers, use a fresh `NEON_VIO_BUILD_DIR` to preserve the previous build.
The core, g2o and adapter use the same 16-byte Eigen alignment ABI. The build
patch removes g2o's private `-march=native`, because mixed AVX/SSE builds also
disagree on Eigen allocation/free policy; matching object alignment alone
does not prevent crashes. See the
[Eigen alignment documentation](https://libeigen.gitlab.io/eigen/docs-nightly/TopicPreprocessorDirectives.html).

```bash
mkdir -p output/neon_vio_deps
git clone https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3.git output/neon_vio_deps/ORB_SLAM3
git -C output/neon_vio_deps/ORB_SLAM3 checkout 4452a3c4ab75b1cde34e5505a36ec3f9edcdc4c4
git clone --branch v0.8 https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git output/neon_vio_deps/Pangolin
git -C output/neon_vio_deps/Pangolin checkout aff6883c83f3fd7e8268a9715e84266c42e2efe3
bash scripts/build_neon_vio.sh
```

`build_neon_vio.sh [ORB_CHECKOUT] [PANGOLIN_CHECKOUT] [INSTALL_PREFIX]` checks
the pinned revisions and applies `slam/export_neon.patch` and
`slam/build_compat.patch` (GCC-specific integer includes use the standard header;
legacy `bool++` uses assignment to `true`, preserving its C++11 behavior while
allowing C++17). The small export
patch saves final **scene-camera** poses after mapping/loop-closure threads
finish. It retains the gravity-aligned SLAM world; the standard inertial EuRoC
export instead saves body poses in a rotated body-origin frame. Tracking and
optimization algorithms are unchanged. Duplicate fallback history entries for
empty poses are omitted rather than reused as missing-frame poses. ORB-SLAM3 and the linked adapter
executable use the upstream GPLv3 license.

Prepare a short interval before attempting the entire recording:

```bash
python prepare_neon_vio.py --input 2026-09-30_15-22-47 \
  --start_n 0 --max_n 1200 --width 800 --experimental-noise --check-sync

# Needed when C++ dependencies were installed in the default local prefix.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/output/neon_vio_deps/prefix/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$PWD/output/neon_vio_deps/prefix/usr/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
output/neon_vio_build/mono_inertial_neon \
  output/neon_vio_deps/ORB_SLAM3/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt \
  output/neon_vio/2026-09-30_15-22-47/prepared \
  output/neon_vio/2026-09-30_15-22-47/slam

python convert_neon_trajectory.py \
  --prepared output/neon_vio/2026-09-30_15-22-47/prepared \
  --trajectory output/neon_vio/2026-09-30_15-22-47/slam/camera_trajectory.csv \
  --states output/neon_vio/2026-09-30_15-22-47/slam/states.csv \
  --output output/neon_vio/2026-09-30_15-22-47/geometry
```

The preparation preserves source frame IDs and original integer `.time`
timestamps. SLAM uses seconds relative to an integer epoch, rectified images
with matching intrinsics, gyro in rad/s and acceleration in m/s² **including
gravity**. It excludes images outside IMU coverage and records all choices in
`manifest.json`. Default extrinsics are the manufacturer's nominal camera-to-IMU
transform; supply `--extrinsics` with a calibrated 4x4 JSON matrix in metres to
replace it. `--time-source aux` changes only SLAM's image clock, while
`--imu-offset-ms` adds a documented offset to the IMU clock. Exported Boxer
timestamps always remain the original `.time` labels. `--check-sync` diagnoses
visual/gyro rotation consistency; it never applies a candidate offset automatically.

IMU noise density/random walk calibration is absent from the recordings.
`--experimental-noise` explicitly permits an **uncalibrated pilot baseline**.
For calibrated runs, replace it with `--imu-noise noise.json` containing positive
`NoiseGyro`, `NoiseAcc`, `GyroWalk`, `AccWalk` values in ORB-SLAM3's SI conventions
and an optional `source` description. A successful metric initialization is
necessary, but does not establish trajectory accuracy or correct synchronization.

The runner writes per-frame state/mapped-feature/initialization/map/timing information
to `states.csv`. Its default scheduling follows recorded time to give the
background mapper time to work; an optional final numeric argument changes
this pace (`1` default, `0` fastest). Exit code 3 means runtime/final metric
trajectory checks failed, including initialization later lost to resets.
The converter keeps only frames with successful
tracking and runtime/final IMU initialization. Lost frames, source gaps and
map resets split segments; it never invents or interpolates missing poses.
`report.json` includes coverage, segment ranges, speed/rotation-step statistics
and calibration limitations. Empty/nonmetric results cause an error.

Use a segment's **printed `--start_n` and `--max_n`** to select its exact frame
range (replace the placeholders below):

```bash
python run_boxer.py --input 2026-09-30_15-22-47 \
  --neon_geometry output/neon_vio/2026-09-30_15-22-47/geometry/geometry_segment_000.npz \
  --start_n <start_n> --max_n <max_n> --point_cloud off \
  --track --skip_viz --write_name boxer_vio_track
# Replace --track with --fuse and use a different --write_name for fusion.
```

Each segment retains a right-handed Z-up world in metres and translates its
first camera position to the origin. Different segments have independent
origins and must not be fused together without registration. No point cloud
is fabricated: phone depth can later supply registered `points_world`.
Absolute trajectory error cannot be measured without an external reference;
monocular box depth/size remains unvalidated when points are disabled.

The supplied recordings were checked with the experimental noise baseline and
nominal extrinsics. In the first recording's initial 120-second pilot, 1,197
frames were processed: 72 had runtime metric tracking, but 13 IMU
deinitializations/map resets left **zero final metric poses**. The converter
correctly rejected this run. In the second recording's first 30 selected
frames, the 28 IMU-covered images were dark and metric initialization failed.
These results establish input/runner/error handling, **not successful Neon
world tracking or trajectory accuracy**. Bright images with translational
excitation, IMU calibration and independently checked clock alignment still
need evaluation. Timing candidates are diagnostics and have not been adopted
as calibrated offsets.

Tracking/fusion regression used 634 saved real Aria detections over 30 frames,
with points disabled. The tracked CSV preserves 24 source timestamps, 387
history rows and 23 IDs, with the same final tracker state as before the
history-saving change. Fusion produced 37 finite static OBBs. This regression
is separate from Neon trajectory estimation. Per-frame detections remain
usable when no valid trajectory exists.

## run_boxer.py Usage Details

The pipeline supports optional **online 3D tracking** (`--track`) for temporal consistency and **offline 3D fusion** (`--fuse`) for merging detections across frames after all detections have been made.

```bash
# Run on a sample Aria sequence
python run_boxer.py --input hohen_gen1

# Disable visualization (faster, just writes CSV)
python run_boxer.py --input hohen_gen1 --skip_viz

# Custom text prompts
python run_boxer.py --input hohen_gen1 --labels=chair,table,lamp

# Run with online 3D tracking
python run_boxer.py --input hohen_gen1 --track

# Run with post-hoc 3D box fusion
python run_boxer.py --input hohen_gen1 --fuse

# ScanNet sequence
python run_boxer.py --input scene0084_02

# CA-1M sequence
python run_boxer.py --input ca1m-val-42898570

# Omni3D dataset
python run_boxer.py --input SUNRGBD

# Adjust thresholds
python run_boxer.py --input hohen_gen1 --thresh2d 0.3 --thresh3d 0.6

# Force a specific precision (auto-detects bfloat16 on supported CUDA GPUs)
python run_boxer.py --input hohen_gen1 --force_precision float32
```

## Adding Additional Datasets

For the minimal single image lifting with BoxerNet, we require:
* image
* intrinsics calibration (we tested with both Pinhole and Fisheye624 camera models)
* the 3D gravity direction
* Depth is optional but improves performance significantly

For lifting a video sequence we need the same as above plus:
* full 6 DoF pose for each image


## FAQ

**Q: Can I run it on an arbitrary image without any other info?**
A: Theoretically yes, but you would need to estimate the intrinsics and gravity direction. We didn't test that.

**Q: Do you plan to release the training or evaluation code?**
A: No, we do not, because that would require more long-term maintenance from the authors. You can email the first author or leave a GitHub issue if you have any questions about re-implementing the training/evaluation pipeline, but our response may be slow.

**Q: Does it work on a Windows machine?**
A: We did not test it, but running the core model should work.
